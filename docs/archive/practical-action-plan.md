Practical Action Plan — 14-Day Codex-to-SaaS Bootstrap
Day 1–2: Product Vision

Lock in the SaaS model (A/B/C or hybrid).

Define Codex 1.0 scope:

Config UI

GitHub App

Dashboard hosting

Multi-repo automation

Day 3–4: Architecture Blueprint

I can generate this for you:

GitHub App auth flow

Webhook ingestion pipeline

Background processor for rules

Storage (Supabase, PlanetScale, Postgres, Dynamo)

Dashboard UI in Next.js

Codex Agent distribution model

Day 5–7: Codex Cloud UI

Build a minimal UI for:

Repo selection

Track config

Tokens

Status page

Day 8–10: GitHub App

Create a GitHub App with read/write access to Issues, PRs, Actions, Projects.

Implement webhook listener (Next.js API route or Fastify microservice).

Connect your existing Codex automation to this webhook pipeline.

Day 11–12: Multi-repo Telemetry

Codex sends JSON events to your SaaS.

SaaS aggregates dashboards per repo/org/user.

Day 13: Pricing Model

Recommended:

Free: 1 repo

Starter: $9/mo for 5 repos

Pro: $29/mo for 20 repos

Enterprise: $99+/mo

Optional: “Consultant Mode” at $199/mo.

Day 14: MVP Release

Private beta with your own repos

Connect Codex to SaaS → generate real dashboards

Begin writing GitHub Marketplace listing
