# Explicit Non-Behaviors

For clarity, Task Assistant does not:

- Modify repository code
- Create or modify pull requests
- Delete issues, PRs, or branches
- Perform self-healing or speculative actions
- Aggregate data across organizations
- Write dashboards into monitored repositories
- Require users to run scripts manually
- Expose UI elements inside user repositories

All automated behavior is explicit, deterministic, and auditable.
