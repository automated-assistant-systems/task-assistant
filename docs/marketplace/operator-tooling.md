# Operator Tooling (Out of Marketplace Scope)

This repository contains scripts used by operators and developers for:

- Local testing
- Sandbox resets
- Validation and certification
- Development workflows

These scripts:
- Are never executed by the GitHub App
- Are not required for Marketplace users
- Are not referenced in Marketplace onboarding
- Do not run automatically

Marketplace installations interact with Task Assistant only through:
- GitHub App event handling
- Declarative configuration
- Defined runtime components
