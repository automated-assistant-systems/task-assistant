# Phase 2 Exit Criteria — Functional Validation

## Phase Objective

Phase 2 validates **functional correctness and behavioral consistency**
of Task Assistant workflows across real GitHub events.

The goal is *coverage*, not perfection.

---

## Completion Criteria

Phase 2 is considered complete when:

- All defined functional scenarios execute successfully
- Known failures are explicitly recorded in evidence
- Validation runner completes without structural errors
- Evidence reflects reality (PASS or FAIL appropriately)

---

## Known Failure Acceptance

Phase 2 allows completion with known failures when:

- Failures are understood
- Failures are documented
- Failures do not compromise system safety or determinism

These failures become inputs to future enhancement sprints.

---

## Out of Scope for Phase 2

- Stress testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Marketplace readiness validation
- Telemetry completeness

---

## Outcome

Phase 2 establishes:
- A stable functional baseline
- A reusable validation harness
- A clear enhancement backlog

Subsequent phases build on this foundation.
